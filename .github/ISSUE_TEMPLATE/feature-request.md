**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I'm always frustrated when i learn from learning section but if i am not watch full video then also i am getting rewards 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
update the backend process and change the setting to if full video is completted then it can get rewards otherwise anyone don't get any rewards

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
alternative splution is to change the video rewards setting to none for better quality and produce more quality videos

**Additional context**
if you are reduce the rewards and focus on the quality of video then it is good for all stackies
